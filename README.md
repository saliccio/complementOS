# complementOS
Complement OS - A minimal operating system targeting 32-bit x86 (IA-32) architecture.

## Motivation
The main reason behind developing an OS from scratch is to grasp and practice the main concepts behind software, hardware, low-level development, assemblers, compilers, linkers, loaders, and specifically IA-32 architecture.

I believe that reinventing the wheel is beneficial in many aspects.
